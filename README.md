# mayden-challenges
All the challenges I attempted while learning to Programme at Mayden Academy.

# [Print 1-1000-1](https://github.com/turnerror/mayden-challenges/tree/master/1-1000-1)
Challenge requirements:
Prints the numbers 0-1000-0 (every number inbetween), with 1000 only once and each number on a new line in:
1.The fewest PHP characters you can
2. A unique way that no other team members have used
I only did the 1st challenge and decided to only use PHP and not anything external to the file.
