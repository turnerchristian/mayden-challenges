Challenge requirements:

  Prints the numbers 0-1000-0 (every number inbetween), with 1000 only once and each number on a new line in:

    1. The fewest PHP characters you can
    2. A unique way that no other team members have used
    
 I decided to use only PHP and not link to an external file or such as I thought it'd be more interesting.
